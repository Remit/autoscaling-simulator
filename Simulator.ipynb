    "# The Buratino simulator's goal is to provide the fast and cheap testing ground\n",
    "# for the autoscaling policies/mechanism used in interactive transaction-based\n",
    "# applications deployed in the cloud using the containers.\n",
    "# The following models constitute the simulator:\n",
    "# 1) application model - determines the logical structure of the application, i.e.\n",
    "# which services communicate, how much time is required to process particular requests,\n",
    "# how large are the buffers for storing the queries awaiting the processing. Overall,\n",
    "# the application is represented as a general networked queueing model.\n",
    "# The components of the model:\n",
    "# - static -> the connections forming the logic of the application + processing times\n",
    "# - dynamic -> the amount of instances of the application services (containers)\n",
    "# 2) workload/load model - determines the load generated by the users of the application,\n",
    "# i.e. requests times, distribution of the requests in time (e.g. diurnal, seasonal),\n",
    "# the composition of the workload mixture (i.e. distribution of requests in terms of\n",
    "# required processing times, e.g. 80% small reqs, 20% large ones)\n",
    "# 3) scaling model - determines the scaling behaviour of the application, i.e. how\n",
    "# much time might be required to take/conduct the scaling decision.\n",
    "# 4) service level model - determines the expected level(s) of the service provided by\n",
    "# the application as a whole, e.g. in terms of the response times or distirbutions thereof,\n",
    "# in terms of services availability.\n",
    "# 5) platform model (hardware/ virtual machines) - models the most relevant characteristics\n",
    "# of the platform in terms of performance, e.g. the number of hw threads/cores that might\n",
    "# be needed to known to accomodate the demands of the logical service instance in terms\n",
    "# of threads. Note: we are not solving the placement problem! This is something done\n",
    "# by the cloud services provider.\n",
    "# 6) cost model - models the cost of the platform resource used during the simulation.\n",
    "# 7) failure/availability model - determines the failure mode of the platform/app, s.t.\n",
    "# the scaling procedure should be able to compensate for the unpredictably failing nodes.\n",
    "# 8) performance interference/tenancy model - determines, how much CPU stealing can happen\n",
    "# on the platform shared between the simulated application and some other application\n",
    "# co-deployed in the cloud on the same infra.\n",
    "# 9) scaling policy - provides a scaling plan that is executed by the simulation,\n",
    "# follows a particular instance or the combination thereof of scaling policies.\n",
